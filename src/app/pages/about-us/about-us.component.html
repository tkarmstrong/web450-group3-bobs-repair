              <p> Dad,
                  <br />
                  <br>
                  I don't feel I was particularly honest as a child. I did get in trouble when I was younger more often
                  then I
                  would like to admit but that eventually allowed me to join you in your favorite hobby. I know you
                  brought me
                  along so I would stay out of trouble but watching you work on electronics really inspired me, even
                  though I
                  pretended I didn’t care. Over those years I grow to enjoy building, breaking, and tuckering with all
                  sorts
                  of electrons with you. Those really were some of best years of my life, so far.
                  <br />
                  <br>
                  As you know, I have been out of school long enough to know what I want to do with my life.
                  Now that I have grow and experienced some of the world, I am writing you this letter to ask an important
                  question. I want to ask you if you would join me by opening a computer repair store with me. Before you
                  answer, I do have a small condition. I would like to name the shop after you. You have inspired me and
                  encouraged me for as long as I can remember. Now I would like to make you proud (and mom, of course).
                  <br />
                  <br>
                  Hopefully this letter with arrive before I do but I know you will be proud of me regardless of what you
                  decide. I can’t wait to see you and mom and have some of delicious apple pie.
                  <br />
                  <br>
                  Your son,
              </p>
