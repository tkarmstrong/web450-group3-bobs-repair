          <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>My name is Bob Jr. and this company is my way of thanking my father, Bob for all this hard work and passion.
            <br >
            He was an understanding, down to earth, beer drinking guy with the longest patience and the biggest heart. When
        I was a young boy, my father and I would play play Pac-Man more times then I could count. I think I could play
        before I could even walk. We even had a special nickname for when we got in the zone, Blinky time. My father and
        I would discuss work, school, girls, Mom and everything in-between.
        <br >
        As I got older, so did my father and eventually we started getting into his favorite hobby, computer repair. He
        would fix, repair and even built computers for his friends and family. I remember asking my father why he didn’t
        want to do this as a job but he would always respond with he same thing, “I enjoy my hobby so why would i ruin
        it by making it work.”
        We continued to talk about everything but now it included college, marriage and lots more adult things.
        Over those years I grew to enjoy building, breaking, and tinkering with all sorts of electrons. My father and I
        would still find time to play Pac-Man though especially after a rough day.
        <br>
        After my graduation from college, my father suddenly passed away. My family and I were devastated and had a
        difficult time recovering. At this point, I was somewhat lost so knowing what my father would do, I started
        playing Pac-Man.
<br>
        Years later, I had my first customer at my new computer repair shop. I named my shop after my father because he
        was the reason I got into this field. He was and is the inspiration be hide this place. I do think he had one
        thing wrong. If you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life.</p> <p style="color:#e4fe3e">Thank you Dad</p>
